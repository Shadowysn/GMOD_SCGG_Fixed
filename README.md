Installation:

-

To 'Access the Steam Files':

Right-click on a game, select the 'Properties' tab, then click on the Local Files tab on the window that pops up.
It does not strictly need to be Garry's Mod.

Then, click on the 'Browse Local Files' button, and a File Explorer window should pop up.

-

Important: Make sure to disable the other Super Gravity Gun addon from the workshop before starting up a map.

Access the Steam Files, go to steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod, and put the files into the folder.

OR

Access the Steam Files, go to steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons, and make a new folder called something like 'Super Gravity Gun'. Put the files into that created folder. 
This method is more neater, but will require a restart if you've gotten your game open before the files were placed.
