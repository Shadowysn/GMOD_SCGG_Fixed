# GMOD_SCGG_Fixed
Access the Steam Files, go to steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod, and put the files into the folder. 
Make sure to disable the other Super Gravity Gun addon from the workshop before starting up a map.

Update Log from version 1 onwards:

Version 1:
* Effects mostly fixed.
* Now able to pick up combine balls.
* Moar commands: [
* Allow ability to interact with entities, such as those from other addons.
* Enability. Downgrading works properly in HL2:EP1's Direct Intervention.
* Equipping Sound.
* NPC Friendly Fire Enable/Disable.
* Armor fading.
* World-wide dropped weapon vaporization.
* Enable/disable sounds from electrocuted ragdolls.
* HL2 style updated to feature range limitations.

]

* No more insta-killing things with higher-than-125 health. Instead it damages them for 125 health.
* Pick up weapons! :)
* Collision group will be stored. (In a nutshell, it means that a non-collidable barrel will still be non collidable after dropping.)
* Able to kill manhacks by punting them into a wall now.
* Gravity gun pickup simulation. (Combine mines will now be friendly after you drop them, etc.)
* Proper deaths for NPCs and Players.
{List may or may not be accurate.}
